# What are they doing? A Commit-Level Dataset of Hyperactive AI-augmented Developers on GitHub 

This dataset captures the commit activity of a curated set of highly active, agentic software developers on GitHub. For each developer, it provides full commit metadata and daily commit counts spanning the months around the agentic coding explosion.

The goal of this dataset is to enable studies of AI-augmented software engineering behavior, agent adoption patterns, repository switching, commit quality, and temporal activity rhythms. The dataset currently covers 7 developers.

## Data Collection Methodology

Candidate developers are identified with the following sources:
- AI coding conversation on X/Twitter
- Github queries (see `script/find_agentic_ai_coders.py`)
- [Gitista](https://gitista.com/)
- [committers.top](https://committers.top/)
- [claudecount.com](https://www.claudecount.com) leaderboard of Claude Code usage, cross-referenced with GitHub profiles

Selection is then performed as a qualitative curation process by a team of expert software engineering researchers. We do not rely on a single automatic rule. Instead, we combine automated evidence with manual assessment of each candidate developer and their repositories.

Our inclusion workflow has four steps:

1. **Initial screening.** We use public activity signals and commit-volume queries to identify unusually active developers who may be using AI coding tools.
2. **Heuristic agent detection.** We inspect the developer's commits with the heuristics from [`agent-mining`](https://github.com/labri-progress/agent-mining), including co-author trailers, agent-related commit message patterns, and agent-specific files or configuration traces.
3. **Manual repository and commit review.** We read repository contents, inspect commit histories, and examine commit messages, temporal activity patterns, and bursts of work across repositories.
4. **Expert judgment.** When explicit agent traces are absent or incomplete, we rely on researcher judgment to decide whether a developer should still be considered AI-augmented. In those cases, the decision is based on the overall pattern of evidence, including message style, cadence, sustained commit frequency, and repository-level context.

In other words, the dataset is intentionally **curated rather than mechanically filtered**. Explicit agent signals strengthen the evidence, but they are not required in every included case. Some developers leave strong machine-readable traces; others are included because expert review indicates that their working style is consistent with AI-augmented software engineering.

## Commits Over Time

![Commits per month per developer](figures/commits-over-time-separate.png)

Key findings from the figure:

- **Aggregate growth**: Total monthly commits across all developers grew from under 1,000 in Sep 2025 to over 26,000 by Jan–Feb 2026, reflecting a rapid ramp-up in AI-augmented activity over the observation window.
- **Divergent trajectories**: Developers follow distinct patterns rather than a uniform trend. Dicklesworthstone and obra show sustained monotonic growth; steipete and mavam plateau at a high level after an initial ramp; ruvnet peaks in Jan 2026 and then declines; philipp-spiess shows a sudden late adoption spike starting in Jan 2026.
- **Burst-and-collapse (teamchong)**: teamchong exhibits the sharpest burst-and-collapse pattern, peaking at ~3,100 commits in Dec 2025 before dropping to near-zero by Feb 2026 — consistent with their description as a developer with "a super-human burst of commit productivity followed by a fall from grace."

## Dataset Contents

```
developers.json                    # Developer registry with metadata and repo data/
  {developer}-{YYYY}-{MM}.json     # Daily commit data per developer per month
  commits/{sha}.json               # Cached per-commit file-level details
```

### Developer Registry (`developers.json`)

Each entry contains:
- `handle` — GitHub username
- `repos` — list of repositories committed to in the last 90 days

### Monthly Commit Files (`data/{developer}-{YYYY}-{MM}.json`)

Each file contains:
- `developer` — GitHub handle
- `month` — `YYYY-MM`
- `days` — dict keyed by date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), each value containing:
  - `total_count` — number of commits that day
  - `sampled` — number of commits with full metadata fetched
  - `commits` — list of raw GitHub API commit objects

---

## Scripts

All scripts live in `script/` and read a GitHub token from the system keyring
(`service="login2"`, `username="github_token"`).

The [`agent-mining`](https://github.com/labri-progress/agent-mining) repository is included as a submodule and provides the agent-detection heuristics used by `detect-agents.py`.

A GitHub personal access token with `repo` and `read:user` scopes is required, stored in the system keyring:

```python
import keyring
keyring.set_password("login2", "github_token", "<your-token>")
```

### Data Collection

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `collect-commits-per-day.py` | Collects all commits for a developer in a given month via the GitHub GraphQL API. Writes `data/{developer}-{YYYY-MM}.json`. Usage: `python script/collect-commits-per-day.py --developer steipete --month 2025-12` |
| `collect-commit-per-month.py` | Collects monthly commit counts for every developer in `developers.json` by iterating over their non-fork repos (avoids fork inflation). Writes results back to `developers.json`. |
| `list_repos_by_user_with_events.py` | Fetches all repos where a developer committed in the last 3 months via the GitHub GraphQL  API. |
| `collect-tentative-names.py` | Searches GitHub commits for `noreply@anthropic.com` to discover candidate AI-heavy users; filters by commit count and repo count. |

### Analysis

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `analyze-commits.py` | Analyses commit messages using Conventional Commits conventions (type breakdown, scopes, breaking changes). Usage: `python script/analyze-commits.py data/steipete-2025-12.json` |
| `analyze-commit-quality.py` | Scores commits as "good" or "dirty" by fetching changed files from the GitHub API and applying heuristics (focused vs scattered, test coupling, diff size, etc.). Commit details are cached in `data/commits/{sha}.json`. Usage: `python script/analyze-commit-quality.py data/steipete-2025-12.json` |
| `analyze-repo-switching.py` | Analyses how a developer switches between repositories over time (concentration, consecutive switches, bouncebacks, day-by-day timeline). Usage: `python script/analyze-repo-switching.py developers.json --author steipete --month 2025-12` |
| `visualize-file-touches.py` | Fetches per-commit file details and prints a terminal report covering file categories, change sizes, language hotspots, test/docs coupling, and engineering-signal heuristics. Usage: `python script/visualize-file-touches.py developers.json --author steipete --month 2025-12` |
| `detect-agents.py` | Detects which coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) are used in a developer's commits via agent-mining heuristics (co-author trailers, message patterns, config files). Usage: `python script/detect-agents.py data/steipete-2025-12.json` |
| `histogram-commit-time.py` | Prints a horizontal bar chart of commit counts by UTC hour from a monthly data file. Usage: `python script/histogram-commit-time.py data/steipete-2025-12.json` |
| `plot-commits-over-time-separate.py` | Same chart with one subplot per developer. Saves to `data/commits-over-time-separate.png`. |

### Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Collect monthly commit data
python script/collect-commits-per-day.py --developer steipete --month 2025-12

# 2. Analyse the collected data
python script/analyze-commits.py        data/steipete-2025-12.json
python script/analyze-commit-quality.py data/steipete-2025-12.json
python script/detect-agents.py          data/steipete-2025-12.json
python script/histogram-commit-time.py  data/steipete-2025-12.json
python script/analyze-repo-switching.py developers.json --author steipete --month 2025-12
python script/visualize-file-touches.py developers.json --author steipete --month 2025-12

# 3. Visualise trends
python script/plot-commits-over-time-separate.py
```
